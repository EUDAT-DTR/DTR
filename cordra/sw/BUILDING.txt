Note that the implementation details of Cordra and its build
instructions are in flux and should be expected to change!

As of Cordra 1.0.5 in November 2015, Cordra is a Java Servlet
application running in the servlet container provided by a
DO Repository.

The DO Repository source is in the file "src.zip".  Unzip this file in
place and everything should be in the correct locations to build the
repository distribution with "ant bindist".

Another file "cordra-src.zip" contains the source of three other
projects:

(1) "Registrar", which is Cordra proper.  This project builds into the
"ROOT.war" file in the Cordra "data/webapps" directory.  In order to
build, the following jar files will need to be copied from "sw/lib" into
"Registrar/build-deps":

   apache-log4j-extras-1.2.17.jar
   cnriutil.jar
   do.jar
   doapps.jar
   gson-2.3.1.jar
   handle.jar
   javax.servlet-api-3.0.1.jar
   jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.7.jar
   log4j-1.2.17.jar
   lucene-analyzers-common-4.7.2.jar
   lucene-core-4.7.2.jar
   lucene-queryparser-4.7.2.jar
   slf4j-api-1.7.7.jar
   slf4j-log4j12-1.7.7.jar

Also "data/webapps/ROOT.war" should be unzipped into the
"Registrar/WebContent" directory in order to populate
"Registrar/WebContent/WEB-INF/lib".

To build ROOT.war, run "ant war".


(2) "DORepositoryAPI", which builds into the
"dorepository-api-1.1.jar" used by Cordra.  "DORepositoryAPI/lib" will
need to be populated with

   android.jar
   cnriutil.jar
   commons-codec-1.10.jar
   do.jar
   doapps.jar
   gson-2.3.1.jar
   handle.jar
   httpclient-4.3.4.jar
   httpcore-4.3.2.jar
   httpmime-4.3.4.jar
   javax.servlet-api-3.0.1.jar
   jcl-over-slf4j-1.7.7.jar
   je-5.0.104.jar
   mongo-2.10.1.jar
   slf4j-api-1.7.7.jar

Note however that not all of these are run-time Cordra dependencies.
"ant" will build the jar file.


(3) "RepositoryClient", a Java client to the Cordra API.  Currently it
is not used by Cordra itself, but is included for reference.
