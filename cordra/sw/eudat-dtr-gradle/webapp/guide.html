<h1>User Guide</h1>
<p>
Automated processing of large amounts of scientific data, especially across
domains, requires that the data can be parsed without human intervention.<span class="ref"><span class="refnum">[1]</span><span class="refbody">
Note that "without human intervention" does not mean full automation for reuse 
but that each instance of reuse does not require complete human re-interpretation 
of the data.</span></span> Within a given domain that functionality can simply be built into the software,
e.g., the piece of information that appears in this location is always
a temperature reading in centigrade or, at a different level of granularity,
this data set is structured according to Domain Standard A including base types
X, Y, and Z where the base types are things like temperature readings in
centigrade. This knowledge, easily available within a given domain or a set of
closely related research groups, can be built into domain specific processing
workflows. But outside of that domain or environment the ‘local knowledge’
approach can begin to fail and more precision in associating data with the
information needed to process it is required. This also applies across time as
well as domains. What is well known today may be less well-known twenty years
hence but age will not necessarily reduce the value of a data set and indeed
may increase it.
</p>

<p>
We are using the term ‘type’ here as the characterization of data structure, contexts, 
and assumptions. Also, we expect that such ‘typing’ to be applicable at multiple 
levels of granularity, from individual observations up to and including large data 
sets. Optimizing the interactions among all of the producers and consumers of 
digital data requires that those types be defined and permanently associated with 
the data they describe. Further, the utility of those types requires that they be 
standardized, unique, and discoverable. The goal of this working group was to 
address these issues through evaluation of use cases, existing efforts, and potential 
infrastructural solutions, including the development of one or more type registries.
</p>

<p>
Simply listing and describing types in human readable form, say in one or more 
open access wikis, would certainly be a good start. But full realization of the 
potential of types in automated data processing will benefit from a common form of 
machine-readable description of types, i.e., a data model and common expression of 
that data model. This would not only aid in discoverability but also in the analysis of
relations among types and evaluation of overlap and duplication as well as possible 
bootstrapping of automated data processing in some cases.
</p>

<p>
Types will be at different levels of granularity, e.g., individual observations, a set of 
observations composed into a time series, a set of time series describing a complex 
phenomenon, and so forth. The ease of composing lower level, or base, types into 
more complex composite types would be an advantage of a well-managed type 
system.
</p>

<p>
An immediate and compelling use case for a managed system of types comes 
directly out of persistent identifiers (PIDs) for data sets. Accessing a piece of data via 
a PID, either as a direct reference or as the result of a search, requires resolving the 
identifier to get the information needed to access the data. This information must be 
understandable by the client, whether that client is a human or a machine, in order 
for the client to act on it. For a machine, it must be explicitly typed. A type registry 
for PID information types would appear to be an early requirement for coherent 
management of scientific data.
</p>

<p>
Finally, assigning PIDs to types, not to be confused with assigning types to PID 
resolution results, would aid in their management and use. All of the arguments for 
using persistent identifiers for important digital information that must remain 
accessible over long periods of time will apply equally well to whatever form of 
records are kept for data types.
