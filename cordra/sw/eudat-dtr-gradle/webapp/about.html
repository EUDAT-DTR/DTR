<h1>About EUDAT-DTR</h1>

<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Interpretation and use of scientific datasets by those that are not engaged
in the creation or production of those datasets is pivotal for enabling science
that is driven by data and, as such, a fundamental effort needs to be made to
describe scientific datasets in a human-and-machine-readable fashion, enabling
humans and software to parse and understand the semantics, context, and
assumptions behind the data.</p> 


<p>These descriptions, or "Data Type Records", need to complement traditional
descriptive metadata records, providing re-usable descriptions of dataset
structure and semantics, that are independent of the standards and/or best
practices standing behind those descriptions. Moreover, Data Type Records
should be aimed mainly at supporting data processing, while at the same time
offering additional attributes that can be used for certain kinds of
discovery.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>EUDAT-DTR is a user-friendly, secure, and trusted service that allows
researchers, scientific communities and citizen scientists to define, record,
query, and disseminate the descriptions (Data Type Records) of the information
contained in their research datasets, as well as the assumptions and semantic
contexts that need to applied to it.</p>

<p>Currently, EUDAT-DTR allows researchers to include
the following semantic information to their Data Type Records:</p>

<ul>
    <li>measurement units,</li>
    <li>reference coordinate systems,</li>
    <li>variable names used in the data,</li>
    <li>and applicable standards</li>
</ul>

<p>By querying the Data Type Records contained in the service, researchers and
automatic processes alike can discern the internal structure of a scientific
dataset, parse its contents and correctly apply the semantic assumptions and 
contexts intended by the dataset's original creator. Moreover, the service
allows to add value to research data by assigning 
<a href="http://www.pidconsortium.eu/" target="blank_">Persistent Identifiers (PIDs)</a>
that ensure long-lasting access and references to the stored Data Type
Records.</p>

<p>EUDAT-DTR is based on CNRI's <a href="http://www.cordra.org" target="blank_">Cordra</a>,
a Digital Object Management software that provides facilities for the creation
of, and access to, digital information as discrete data structures with unique,
resolvable identifiers based on the <a href="http://handle.net/" target="blank_">Handle
System</a>.</p>
